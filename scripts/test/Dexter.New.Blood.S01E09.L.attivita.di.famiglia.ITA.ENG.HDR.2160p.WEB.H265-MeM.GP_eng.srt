<i>If he wasn't your boyfriend,</i>

3
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:12,639
<i>I would totally do a deep dive.</i>

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,719
<i>Hey, Miles.</i>

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,160
<i>I'm here to ask you</i>

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:17,120
{\an8}<i>about your encounter</i>
<i>with Jim Lindsay.</i>

7
00:00:17,159 --> 00:00:18,240
{\an8}<i>He fucking jumped me.</i>

8
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:19,320
<i>He poked me in the neck with,</i>

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,120
<i>like, a needle or some shit.</i>

10
00:00:21,159 --> 00:00:23,319
{\an8}<i>[Molly]</i> <i>I mean, I got
some really creepy vibes</i>

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,640
<i>from Kurt.</i>

12
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,799
<i>It's the kind that I tell</i>

13
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:26,919
{\an8}<i>my listeners to run away from</i>

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,119
{\an8}<i>as fast as they can.</i>

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,759
{\an8}<i>I think about it all the time.</i>

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,760
{\an8}<i>Hurting people.</i>

17
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,240
{\an8}<i>You've always known.</i>

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,599
{\an8}<i>That's why you left.</i>

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,639
<i>When I came here,
I-I wanted answers.</i>

20
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,200
{\an8}<i>Whoa!</i>

21
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,120
{\an8}<i>[Harrison]</i> <i>I think I was
also looking for...</i>

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,920
{\an8}<i>Real connection with your dad.</i>

23
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:47,560
{\an8}<i>Whatever blood bond</i>

24
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:49,559
<i>most fathers have
with their kids,</i>

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,400
{\an8}<i>it's...
<i>...it's not there.</i></i>

26
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:52,959
{\an8}<i>Where does Kurt have my son?</i>

27
00:00:52,999 --> 00:00:54,560
{\an8}<i>Up at his cabin on Stearn Road.</i>

28
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:56,040
{\an8}<i>Nothing personal.</i>

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,039
{\an8}<i>We're talking about my son.</i>

30
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,280
{\an8}<i>There's nothing more personal</i>
<i>than that.</i>

31
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:02,520
{\an8}<i>Run.</i>

32
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,479
{\an8}<i>Run!</i>

33
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:07,799
{\an8}<i>Harrison!</i>

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,279
<i>What's going on?</i>

35
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,679
{\an8}<i>There's so much</i>
<i>I need to tell you.</i>

36
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,960
{\an8}<i>I should've way before</i>
<i>it got to this.</i>

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,799
{\an8}<i>You have everything?</i>

38
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:29,599
{\an8}<i>Did you guys have fun?</i>

39
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,560
<i>It's a scary world out there.</i>

40
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,600
<i>Guilty people slip
through the cracks</i>

41
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,840
<i>of the justice system every day.</i>

42
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,559
{\an8}<i>Ooh!</i>

43
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,439
{\an8}<i>Oh! Wiggles loves it!</i>

44
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,240
<i>ominous music</i>

45
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,919
{\an8}<i>And there he is,</i>
<i>Jeremiah the giraffe,</i>

46
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:51,720
{\an8}<i>for the birthday girl. Mwah!</i>

47
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,559
{\an8}<i>Now, can I have everybody say,</i>

48
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,440
{\an8}<i>"Happy Birthday, Sam!"</i>

49
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,520
{\an8}<i>Happy Birthday, Sam!</i>

50
00:01:57,559 --> 00:01:59,319
{\an8}<i>Oh, and let me get a picture</i>

51
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,439
{\an8}<i>of the birthday girl.</i>

52
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,999
{\an8}<i>
<i>-Okay.</i></i>

53
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:05,359
{\an8}<i>And all of you...</i>

54
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:08,080
<i>Murderers. Rapists. Predators.</i>

55
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,639
<i>Monsters who walk among us,</i>

56
00:02:12,679 --> 00:02:15,040
<i>and we never even know.</i>

57
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,240
<i>Counting on the justice system
to discover these predators</i>

58
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:20,319
<i>and effectively deal with them</i>

59
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:22,239
<i>is not an option.</i>

60
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,679
<i>Not for me.</i>

61
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,280
<i>I don't follow society's rules.</i>

62
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,919
<i>But that doesn't mean
there aren't rules</i>

63
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,679
<i>I have to follow
when the Dark Passenger calls.</i>

64
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,240
<i>Wait.</i>

65
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:12,319
<i>What-What's the Dark Passenger?</i>

66
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,840
{\an8}<i>It's the name I gave the...</i>

67
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,959
{\an8}<i>-calling that I have.</i>
<i>Hey.</i>

68
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:20,159
{\an8}<i>Careful.</i>

69
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,480
{\an8}<i>Always there,</i>

70
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,400
{\an8}<i>riding alongside me.</i>

71
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,600
{\an8}<i>Giving me...</i>

72
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,759
{\an8}<i>A lot of bad ideas.</i>

73
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,079
{\an8}<i>Sometimes...</i>

74
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,759
{\an8}<i>...I have the urge</i>
<i>to hurt people.</i>

75
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:57,120
{\an8}<i>An urge too strong to ignore.</i>

76
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,439
{\an8}<i>The Dark Passenger.</i>

77
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,959
{\an8}<i>That sounds right.</i>

78
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,800
{\an8}<i>W-Why...</i>

79
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,240
{\an8}<i>...why-why are we like this?</i>

80
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:20,000
{\an8}<i>We both saw our mothers murdered</i>

81
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:21,999
{\an8}<i>when we were young.</i>

82
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,999
{\an8}<i>You, too?</i>

83
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,079
{\an8}<i>I-I've always felt so alone.</i>

84
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:45,599
{\an8}<i>I thought no one</i>
<i>could understand me.</i>

85
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,560
{\an8}<i>I-I mean, if I, if I</i>

86
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:49,439
{\an8}<i>talked about this shit</i>
<i>with anyone...</i>

87
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,919
{\an8}<i>They'd lock you up.</i>

88
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:56,360
{\an8}<i>When your grandfather Harry</i>

89
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,479
{\an8}<i>found out what I was...</i>

90
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,199
{\an8}<i>I thought he'd send me</i>
<i>to an institution.</i>

91
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:07,919
{\an8}<i>But instead...</i>

92
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,039
{\an8}<i>he gave me the Code.</i>

93
00:05:11,559 --> 00:05:13,239
<i>It's a rigid process.</i>

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,959
<i>Once someone is identified
as worthy of the Code,</i>

95
00:05:16,999 --> 00:05:20,159
<i>100% proof of their crimes
must be found.</i>

96
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:23,759
<i>gentle, dramatic music</i>

97
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,599
{\an8}<i>It's not always easy to find.</i>

98
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:03,359
{\an8}<i>Secrets are secret for a reason.</i>

99
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,919
{\an8}<i>As a cop, Harry saw too many</i>
<i>criminals get arrested</i>

100
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,199
{\an8}<i>and escape the law.</i>

101
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:25,679
{\an8}<i>Then hurt innocent people</i>
<i>over and over.</i>

102
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,999
{\an8}<i>He taught me how to make sure</i>

103
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:29,760
{\an8}<i>they never hurt anyone</i>
<i>ever again.</i>

104
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:31,039
<i>So...</i>

105
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:33,199
{\an8}<i>when did your dad</i>
<i>decide to teach you</i>

106
00:06:33,239 --> 00:06:36,319
{\an8}<i>this Code?</i>

107
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:37,759
{\an8}<i>I was about your age</i>

108
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:40,720
{\an8}<i>when I started exhibiting</i>
<i>violent tendencies.</i>

109
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:43,519
{\an8}<i>Harry kept it a secret</i>
<i>from the rest of the family.</i>

110
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:45,079
{\an8}<i>Fucking-A he did.</i>

111
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,559
{\an8}<i>Well, they would've been</i>
<i>afraid of you.</i>

112
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:48,999
{\an8}<i>But I would never hurt family.</i>

113
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,439
{\an8}<i>Harry gave me the Code</i>
<i>as a way to channel</i>

114
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:57,879
{\an8}<i>the Dark Passenger.</i>

115
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,359
{\an8}<i>To use it for good.</i>

116
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:01,999
{\an8}<i>F-For good?</i>

117
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:04,079
{\an8}<i>And a way forward in life.</i>

118
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,719
{\an8}<i>Ooh!</i>

119
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:17,079
{\an8}<i>You like... the caramel?</i>

120
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:20,640
{\an8}<i>Oh!</i>

121
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:21,600
{\an8}<i>Oh.</i>

122
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,919
{\an8}<i>Oh...</i>

123
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,439
{\an8}<i></i>

124
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,279
{\an8}<i>What the fuck?</i>

125
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,319
{\an8}<i>[Dexter]</i> <i>Once I have proof
of their crimes,</i>

126
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:37,959
<i>the Code allows me to stop them
from hurting others.</i>

127
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:46,319
<i>I do what the law failed to do.</i>

128
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,399
<i>I fix things.</i>

129
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:58,919
{\an8}<i>Hello.</i>

130
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,439
{\an8}<i>You kidnapped him?</i>

131
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,640
{\an8}<i>I did.</i>

132
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:10,599
{\an8}<i>Wiggles was a threat.</i>
<i>He would've</i>

133
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,159
{\an8}<i>tortured and killed that kid.</i>

134
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,239
{\an8}<i>Hey. That's enough.</i>

135
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,519
{\an8}<i>Well, then what?</i>

136
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,639
{\an8}<i>So...</i>

137
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:21,599
{\an8}<i>I prepare a place to...</i>

138
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,959
{\an8}<i>...confront these bad people.</i>

139
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:28,319
<i>gentle, dramatic music</i>

140
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:31,039
<i>I have to be very neat</i>

141
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:33,559
<i>because the world will never
understand what I do.</i>

142
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:37,919
<i>I always show them
their victims.</i>

143
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,039
<i>It's important
that they open their eyes</i>

144
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:43,159
<i>and look at what they've done.</i>

145
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:47,399
{\an8}<i>You abso-fucking-lutely</i>
<i>cannot tell Harrison</i>

146
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,039
{\an8}<i>about your sick-ass ritual.</i>

147
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,599
{\an8}<i>What the hell is this?</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

148
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:14,719
{\an8}<i>They always say</i>
<i>some shit like that.</i>

149
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,399
{\an8}<i>Stop clowning around, Wiggles.</i>

150
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:21,359
{\an8}<i>You know exactly</i>
<i>what's going on.</i>

151
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:23,039
{\an8}<i>You...</i>

152
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:26,079
{\an8}<i>remember... them all.</i>

153
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:37,599
{\an8}<i>You tell Harrison that you kill</i>
<i>people, there's no going back.</i>

154
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,559
{\an8}<i>So, doing that...</i>

155
00:09:42,599 --> 00:09:44,639
{\an8}<i>confronting him...</i>

156
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:46,879
{\an8}<i>that-that made him stop?</i>

157
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,319
{\an8}<i>Scaring him like that?</i>

158
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:53,558
{\an8}<i>Fine.</i>

159
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:01,639
{\an8}<i>I won't tell him.</i>

160
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,879
{\an8}<i>Yes. He never hurt anyone again.</i>

161
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,079
{\an8}<i>So, you're-you're kind of like</i>
<i>Batman or something.</i>

162
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,559
{\an8}<i>I like Dark Defender.</i>

163
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:16,598
{\an8}<i>And that...</i>

164
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,599
{\an8}<i>that makes the Dark Passenger</i>
<i>not push so hard?</i>

165
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,319
{\an8}<i>This is a lot.</i>

166
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:32,079
{\an8}<i>It's not every day</i>
<i>you're nearly murdered</i>

241
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:22,998

<i>-I got it.</i>

244
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:43,718

245
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,238
{\an8}<i>That's better</i>

246

{\an8}<i>He's a natural.</i>

247
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,639
{\an8}<i>So, I was, I was thinking</i>
<i>about Kurt last night.</i>

248
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:03,038
{\an8}<i>Oh?</i>

249
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:06,198
{\an8}<i>Was he trying to kill me because</i>
<i>you were going after him,</i>

250
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:07,799
{\an8}<i>like-like with Wiggles?</i>

251
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,399
{\an8}<i>Kurt has been killing innocent</i>
<i>women for the last 25 years.</i>

252
00:16:17,438 --> 00:16:20,318
{\an8}<i>Wait, what? Wh...</i>

253
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,799
{\an8}<i>Kurt's a serial killer?</i>

254
00:16:21,838 --> 00:16:24,558
{\an8}<i>H-How long have you known this?</i>

255
00:16:24,598 --> 00:16:25,919
{\an8}<i>I just found out.</i>

256
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,558
{\an8}<i>Why didn't, why didn't you</i>
<i>tell Angela?</i>

257
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:30,878
{\an8}<i>I don't have any proof.</i>

258
00:16:30,918 --> 00:16:32,278
{\an8}<i>Not yet.</i>

259
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:35,079
{\an8}<i>Plus Kurt's already</i>
<i>been arrested</i>

260
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:36,559
{\an8}<i>for one murder.</i>

261
00:16:36,599 --> 00:16:38,759
{\an8}<i>-And he got away with it.</i>
<i>-Yup.</i>

262
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:43,439
{\an8}<i>Wh-What if I testified</i>
<i>that he tried to shoot me?</i>

263
00:16:43,478 --> 00:16:45,879
{\an8}<i>That-That's</i>
<i>attempted murder, right?</i>

264
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:48,198
{\an8}<i>And then Angela starts to ask</i>
<i>a lot of questions</i>

265
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:50,198
{\an8}<i>about what I was doing</i>
<i>out on his property.</i>

266
00:16:50,238 --> 00:16:52,958
{\an8}<i>Questions I can't answer.</i>

267
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:55,519
{\an8}<i>Vigilante shit.</i>

268
00:16:55,558 --> 00:16:57,878
{\an8}<i>Yeah.</i>

269
00:16:57,918 --> 00:17:01,399
{\an8}<i>Vigilante shit.</i>

270
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,999
{\an8}<i>But I do have a plan</i>

271
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:06,558
{\an8}<i>to make sure Kurt</i>
<i>can't hurt anyone else.</i>

272
00:17:07,999 --> 00:17:10,719
<i>Ask me what the plan is.</i>

273
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:12,639
<i>Ask me if you can help.</i>

274
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:16,799
{\an8}Shit, I-I forgot.

275
00:17:16,838 --> 00:17:19,198
{\an8}<i>I, um, I made you a gift.</i>

276
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:21,118
{\an8}<i>One second.</i>

277
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:33,438
{\an8}<i>I know it's not much.</i>

278
00:17:33,479 --> 00:17:36,639
{\an8}<i>It's kind of how I remember her.</i>

279
00:17:42,238 --> 00:17:44,438
{\an8}<i>Thank you. I love it.</i>

280
00:17:46,998 --> 00:17:48,918

281
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,558
{\an8}<i>got any more bottles somewhere?</i>

282
00:17:50,598 --> 00:17:52,878

<i>Voices singing
let's be jolly...</i>

327
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,959
{\an8}<i>Ah, food.</i>

328
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,039
{\an8}<i>
<i>-My favorite part of Christmas.</i></i>

329
00:20:09,078 --> 00:20:10,878
<i>Rockin' around</i>

330
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:17,358
{\an8}<i>Nice.</i>

331
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:18,718
{\an8}<i>Very nice.</i>

332
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:19,838
{\an8}<i>Go Hawks.</i>

333
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:22,158
{\an8}<i>
<i>-Your turn.</i></i>

334
00:20:28,838 --> 00:20:30,559
{\an8}<i>Look at you,</i>

335
00:20:30,598 --> 00:20:32,158
{\an8}<i>feeding my addiction.</i>

336
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:33,839
{\an8}<i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i></i>

337
00:20:33,878 --> 00:20:35,639
{\an8}<i>We'll have to get one</i>
<i>for you next year, huh?</i>

338
00:20:35,678 --> 00:20:37,878
{\an8}<i>I'm-I'm good with just this one.</i>

339
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:39,479
{\an8}<i></i>

340
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:41,119
{\an8}<i>Uh...</i>

341
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:44,478
{\an8}<i>Uh, you'll have to remember,</i>
<i>uh, my dad gets a discount</i>

342
00:20:44,518 --> 00:20:46,558
{\an8}<i>-at a certain store.</i>
<i>Mm.</i>

343
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:49,558
{\an8}<i>Aren't a lot of options</i>
<i>in the Iron Lake.</i>

344
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:04,439
{\an8}<i>I love it.</i>

345
00:21:04,478 --> 00:21:06,558
<i>Nó'yeh,</i>

346
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,598
{\an8}<i>what do you think?</i>

347
00:21:08,638 --> 00:21:10,358
{\an8}<i>-It's lovely.</i>
<i></i>

348
00:21:10,398 --> 00:21:12,438
{\an8}<i>It's your turn. Open your gift.</i>

349
00:21:20,678 --> 00:21:22,638
{\an8}<i>Huh.</i>

350
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:26,198
<i>The Police Handbook on
Searches, Seizures and Arrests.</i>

351
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:27,998
{\an8}<i>My father Harry had</i>
<i>a lot of books like that</i>

352
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:29,518
{\an8}<i>and used them a lot.</i>

353
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:31,838
{\an8}<i>Saw you didn't have it</i>
<i>in your library, so...</i>

354
00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:34,398
{\an8}<i>That's very thoughtful.</i>

355
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:35,678
{\an8}<i>And so romantic, Jim.</i>

356
00:21:37,598 --> 00:21:39,638
{\an8}<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i></i>

357
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,358
<i>A successful Christmas.</i>

358
00:21:42,398 --> 00:21:43,958
<i>Surrounded by family.</i>

359
00:21:46,598 --> 00:21:48,158
{\an8}<i>Who could that be?</i>

360
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:55,999
{\an8}<i>Merry Christmas, Chief.</i>

361
00:21:56,038 --> 00:21:57,958
{\an8}<i>Kurt, what are you doing here?</i>

362
00:21:57,998 --> 00:21:59,638
{\an8}<i>Mind if I come in?</i>

363
00:21:59,678 --> 00:22:01,438
{\an8}<i>Uh...</i>

364
00:22:01,478 --> 00:22:03,718
{\an8}I just brought you
<i>a little gift,</i>

365
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:05,759
{\an8}<i>show you that there's</i>
<i>no hard feelings.</i>

366
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:08,278
{\an8}<i>Oh. Thanks, Kurt.</i>

367
00:22:08,318 --> 00:22:10,078
{\an8}<i>Jim.</i>

368
00:22:10,118 --> 00:22:11,798
{\an8}<i>Harrison.</i>

369
00:22:11,838 --> 00:22:14,358
{\an8}If I'd known you guys
<i>were gonna be here,</i>

370
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,238
{\an8}<i>I would've brought you two</i>
<i>a little something as well.</i>

371
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:18,478
{\an8}<i>Ah.</i>

372
00:22:18,518 --> 00:22:20,078
{\an8}<i>I'm just jealous that Jimbo here</i>

373
00:22:20,118 --> 00:22:22,079
{\an8}<i>gets to spend the holidays</i>
<i>with his son.</i>

374
00:22:22,118 --> 00:22:24,798
{\an8}Yeah, I hear you.
<i>It certainly would be</i>

375
00:22:24,838 --> 00:22:28,558
{\an8}<i>a tough Christmas</i>
<i>without Harrison by my side.</i>

376
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:31,358
{\an8}<i>Would've ruined</i>
<i>the whole holiday.</i>

377
00:22:31,399 --> 00:22:34,238
{\an8}<i>Yeah. Well, peace be with you.</i>

378
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:36,758
{\an8}<i>And also with you.</i>

379
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:39,678
{\an8}<i>Merry Christmas</i>
<i>to you, too, kiddo.</i>

380
00:22:39,718 --> 00:22:41,478
{\an8}<i>Hope to see you around.</i>

381
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:45,918
{\an8}<i>Well, hey, enjoy</i>
<i>the peppermint bark.</i>

382
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,318
{\an8}<i>Had it shipped in from the city.</i>
<i>It's the best around.</i>

383
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,198
{\an8}<i>Well, Ange,</i>
<i>Harrison and I got to go.</i>

384
00:22:56,238 --> 00:22:57,478
{\an8}<i>What? No.</i>

385
00:22:57,518 --> 00:22:59,878
{\an8}<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

386
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,439
{\an8}Dad and I had

387
00:23:01,478 --> 00:23:03,158
{\an8}<i>plans to go...</i>

388
00:23:03,198 --> 00:23:05,158
{\an8}<i>um, shooting.</i>

389
00:23:05,198 --> 00:23:07,358
{\an8}<i>Yeah, I got Harrison</i>
<i>a rifle for Christmas.</i>

390
00:23:07,398 --> 00:23:09,278
{\an8}<i>He wants to try it out.</i>

391
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:11,198
{\an8}<i>So, love you.</i>

392
00:23:11,238 --> 00:23:13,158
{\an8}<i>See you tonight.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

393
00:23:15,198 --> 00:23:16,118
{\an8}<i>I'll...</i>

394
00:23:16,158 --> 00:23:18,478
{\an8}<i>I'll talk to you later.</i>

395
00:23:18,518 --> 00:23:20,318
{\an8}<i>I'll see you.</i>

396
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:27,438
{\an8}<i>That was weird, right?</i>

397
00:23:27,478 --> 00:23:31,158
{\an8}<i>It's his first Christmas</i>
<i>with his son in a long time.</i>

398
00:23:31,199 --> 00:23:33,438
{\an8}<i>It's not that weird.</i>

399
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,758
<i>suspenseful music</i>

400
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:37,678
{\an8}<i>He didn't run.</i>

401
00:23:37,718 --> 00:23:39,038
{\an8}<i>Do you think</i>
<i>he's sticking around</i>

402
00:23:39,078 --> 00:23:40,558
{\an8}<i>-to finish what he started?</i>
<i></i>

403
00:23:40,598 --> 00:23:41,438
{\an8}<i>What-what if he goes</i>
<i>after Audrey or something?</i>

404
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:43,198
{\an8}<i>Just get in the truck.</i>

405
00:23:43,238 --> 00:23:45,838
<i>I know what I want to do.</i>

406
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,918
<i>But I'm not alone in this.</i>

407
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:56,118
{\an8}<i>What if we did</i>
<i>what you did with Wiggles?</i>

408
00:23:58,278 --> 00:23:59,878
{\an8}<i>We'd have to find proof first.</i>

409
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:01,678
{\an8}<i>Like the pictures</i>
<i>the clown had of the kids?</i>

410
00:24:01,718 --> 00:24:04,358
{\an8}<i>Yeah. Killers like Kurt</i>

411
00:24:04,398 --> 00:24:07,878
{\an8}<i>usually keep some kind</i>
<i>of trophy, a memento,</i>

412
00:24:07,918 --> 00:24:09,878
{\an8}<i>to remember what</i>
<i>they did to their victims.</i>

413
00:24:09,918 --> 00:24:12,358
{\an8}<i>It could be anything,</i>
<i>piece of clothing,</i>

414
00:24:12,398 --> 00:24:15,118
{\an8}<i>jewelry, photo.</i>

415
00:24:15,158 --> 00:24:16,518
{\an8}<i>They know it could</i>
<i>get them caught,</i>

416
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:18,598
{\an8}<i>but they can't help themselves.</i>

417
00:24:18,638 --> 00:24:20,518
{\an8}<i>You think Kurt does that?</i>

418
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:23,358
{\an8}<i>And I think he keeps them</i>
<i>on his property,</i>

419
00:24:23,398 --> 00:24:25,438
{\an8}<i>near the cabin.</i>

420
00:24:30,598 --> 00:24:32,238
{\an8}<i>Salena?</i>

421
00:24:35,078 --> 00:24:37,878
{\an8}<i>Merry Christmas, Angela.</i>

422
00:24:37,918 --> 00:24:39,638
{\an8}<i>Everything all right?</i>

423
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:42,038
{\an8}<i>Yeah, just, the job doesn't pay</i>
<i>attention to the holidays,</i>

424
00:24:42,078 --> 00:24:43,678
{\an8}<i>but I do come bearing gifts.</i>

425
00:24:43,718 --> 00:24:46,958
{\an8}<i>Just doing a little follow-up</i>
<i>on a case, um...</i>

426
00:24:46,998 --> 00:24:49,919
{\an8}<i>Think you could open the books</i>
<i>on purchases of ketamine?</i>

427
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:51,839
{\an8}<i>In the last month or so?</i>

428
00:24:51,878 --> 00:24:53,678
{\an8}<i>Oh... Um...</i>

429
00:24:58,118 --> 00:25:00,638
{\an8}<i>Yup. I've got three</i>
<i>in last month.</i>

430
00:25:00,678 --> 00:25:02,278
{\an8}<i>Mrs. Gross for her sheep.</i>

431
00:25:02,318 --> 00:25:04,278
{\an8}<i>Um, Al Chung for his cows,</i>

432
00:25:04,318 --> 00:25:05,478
{\an8}<i>and Mr. Harris</i>

433
00:25:05,518 --> 00:25:07,318
{\an8}<i>for his 37 cats.</i>

434
00:25:09,478 --> 00:25:10,958
{\an8}<i>Great.</i>

435
00:25:10,998 --> 00:25:12,438
{\an8}<i>Oh, wait.</i>

436
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:13,758
{\an8}<i>Your boyfriend Jim.</i>

437
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:15,598
{\an8}<i>Said he needed it for his goat,</i>

438
00:25:15,638 --> 00:25:17,358
{\an8}<i>Vincent van Goat.</i>

439
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:19,038
{\an8}<i>That's a cute name.</i>

440
00:25:20,638 --> 00:25:22,238
{\an8}<i>Thanks.</i>

441
00:25:22,278 --> 00:25:23,918
<i>dramatic music</i>

442
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:25,758
{\an8}<i>Yo, Kurt.</i>

443
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:27,998
{\an8}<i>Fuck you</i>
<i>and thanks for the drone.</i>

444
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:30,478
{\an8}<i>Ah, the gift</i>
<i>that keeps on giving.</i>

445
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:34,518
<i>People don't just vanish.</i>

446
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:36,918
<i>I know, I've tried.</i>

447
00:25:53,478 --> 00:25:55,318
{\an8}<i>I have to tell you something.</i>

448
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:58,838
{\an8}<i>You were right...</i>

449
00:25:58,878 --> 00:26:01,518
{\an8}<i>about what I did.</i>

450
00:26:03,118 --> 00:26:04,518
{\an8}<i>With Ethan.</i>

451
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:10,758
{\an8}<i>I mean, shit, I-I-I set</i>
<i>the whole thing up</i>

452
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:13,278
{\an8}<i>so that I could</i>
<i>get away with it.</i>

453
00:26:13,318 --> 00:26:15,318
{\an8}<i>Maybe even look like a hero.</i>

454
00:26:22,838 --> 00:26:24,318
{\an8}<i>How did you know?</i>

455
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:27,878
{\an8}<i>Blood spatter analysis.</i>

456
00:26:29,318 --> 00:26:31,158
{\an8}<i>From my Homicide days.</i>

457
00:26:35,238 --> 00:26:37,398
{\an8}<i>I'm-I'm sorry</i>
<i>I-I treated you like shit</i>

458
00:26:37,438 --> 00:26:38,758
{\an8}<i>when you knew the truth.</i>

459
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:42,558
{\an8}<i>I was...</i>

460
00:26:42,598 --> 00:26:45,158
{\an8}<i>I was just afraid.</i>

461
00:26:48,998 --> 00:26:52,638
{\an8}<i>Wh-Why didn't you tell me</i>
<i>all this back then?</i>

462
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:55,957
{\an8}<i>I wanted to.</i>

463
00:26:55,998 --> 00:26:58,878
{\an8}<i>But I needed to try out</i>
<i>everything else first.</i>

464
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:01,918
{\an8}<i>Therapy.</i>

465
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:03,838
{\an8}<i>That's why you were</i>
<i>so closed off.</i>

466
00:27:03,878 --> 00:27:06,517
{\an8}<i>I knew you were</i>
<i>hiding something.</i>

467
00:27:16,518 --> 00:27:18,198
{\an8}<i>I've been thinking</i>
<i>about Wiggles.</i>

468
00:27:18,238 --> 00:27:20,438
{\an8}<i>About the end.</i>

469
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:24,638
{\an8}<i>You said you</i>

470
00:27:24,678 --> 00:27:26,998
{\an8}<i>made sure he didn't hurt</i>
<i>anyone else again.</i>

471
00:27:28,518 --> 00:27:31,278
{\an8}<i>I mean, scaring the shit</i>
<i>out of him,</i>

472
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:33,758
{\an8}<i>even hurting him.</i>

473
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:37,598
{\an8}<i>I mean, that-that</i>
<i>doesn't feel...</i>

474
00:27:37,638 --> 00:27:39,638
{\an8}<i>I don't know...</i>

475
00:27:39,678 --> 00:27:41,637
{\an8}<i>like justice.</i>

476
00:27:43,678 --> 00:27:46,157
{\an8}<i>And what would...</i>

477
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:49,118
{\an8}<i>justice feel like to you?</i>

478
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:57,198
{\an8}<i>When I was 12 years old,</i>
<i>I started having fantasies about</i>

479
00:27:57,238 --> 00:27:59,958
{\an8}<i>hunting down the Trinity Killer.</i>

480
00:27:59,998 --> 00:28:02,398
{\an8}<i>You know he just</i>
<i>up and disappeared?</i>

481
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:06,878
{\an8}<i>I wanted to kill him.</i>

482
00:28:08,517 --> 00:28:10,598
{\an8}<i>With his own razor.</i>

483
00:28:14,998 --> 00:28:16,958
{\an8}<i>I wanted to do it slowly.</i>

484
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:27,958
{\an8}<i>I understand.</i>

485
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:47,038
{\an8}<i>Wait. Hold it right there.</i>

486
00:28:47,078 --> 00:28:50,358
{\an8}<i>That's... strange.</i>

487
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:52,798
{\an8}<i>See that? Can you go in closer?</i>

488
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:56,958
{\an8}<i>That's right where</i>
<i>Kurt disappeared.</i>

489
00:28:56,998 --> 00:28:58,998
{\an8}<i>Holy shit. That's big.</i>

490
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:00,958
{\an8}<i>That could be where he kills.</i>

491
00:29:00,998 --> 00:29:03,078
{\an8}<i>Maybe where he keeps</i>
<i>his trophies.</i>

492
00:29:07,998 --> 00:29:09,878
{\an8}<i>I-Is that a vent?</i>

493
00:29:11,518 --> 00:29:12,958
{\an8}<i>-Let's go.</i>
<i>-Wait.</i>

494
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:17,878
{\an8}<i>
<i>don't get caught.</i></i>

495
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:19,198
{\an8}<i>We wait until dark.</i>

496
00:29:19,238 --> 00:29:21,958
{\an8}<i>Come back tonight</i>
<i>and check it out.</i>

497
00:29:21,998 --> 00:29:23,838
{\an8}<i>Okay.</i>

498
00:29:23,878 --> 00:29:26,198
<i>Outside of Harold Shipman</i>

499
00:29:26,238 --> 00:29:27,878
<i>or Luis Garavito,</i>

500
00:29:27,917 --> 00:29:29,437
<i>the Bay Harbor Butcher</i>

501
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:31,357
<i>was one of the most prolific</i>

502
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:34,718
<i>serial killers of all time.</i>

503
00:29:34,758 --> 00:29:37,598
<i>He's one of the most
sick-ass, decapitating,</i>

504
00:29:37,638 --> 00:29:40,318
<i>dismembering murderers
out there.</i>

505
00:29:40,358 --> 00:29:42,197
<i>And by the end of this podcast,</i>

506
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,918
<i>I'm gonna challenge everything</i>

507
00:29:43,957 --> 00:29:45,357
<i>you may think you know about</i>

508
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:48,158
<i>who... he... was.</i>

509
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:56,758
{\an8}<i>Hey.</i>

510
00:29:56,798 --> 00:29:59,197
{\an8}<i>Hey, yourself.</i>

511
00:29:59,238 --> 00:30:00,798
{\an8}<i>Look,</i>

512
00:30:00,837 --> 00:30:03,037
{\an8}<i>I hope it doesn't bum you</i>
<i>and Audrey out too much,</i>

513
00:30:03,078 --> 00:30:04,878
{\an8}<i>but would it be okay if</i>

514
00:30:04,918 --> 00:30:06,718
{\an8}<i>Harrison and I don't</i>
<i>come over tonight?</i>

515
00:30:06,758 --> 00:30:08,598
{\an8}<i>Me and the kid have been</i>
<i>really bonding.</i>

516
00:30:08,638 --> 00:30:10,157
{\an8}<i>That's really great.</i>

517
00:30:10,198 --> 00:30:11,918
{\an8}<i>Uh, it's no problem.</i>

518
00:30:11,957 --> 00:30:14,157
<i>Yeah, we're gonna go
on a night hike</i>

519
00:30:14,198 --> 00:30:16,838
{\an8}<i>and check out that blood moon</i>
<i>that's been happening.</i>

520
00:30:16,877 --> 00:30:19,357
{\an8}<i>That's fine. Have fun.</i>

521
00:30:19,398 --> 00:30:21,557
{\an8}<i>Yeah. Merry Christmas. Love you.</i>

522
00:30:21,598 --> 00:30:24,518
{\an8}<i>Merry Christmas to you, too.</i>

523
00:30:26,757 --> 00:30:28,598
<i>As I walk along</i>

524
00:30:28,638 --> 00:30:30,358
<i>I wonder</i>

525
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:33,398
<i>A-what went wrong
with our love</i>

526
00:30:33,438 --> 00:30:36,598
<i>A love that was so strong</i>

527
00:30:38,277 --> 00:30:40,798
<i>And as I still walk on</i>

528
00:30:40,838 --> 00:30:42,558
{\an8}<i>
<i>- I think of</i></i>

529
00:30:42,598 --> 00:30:43,878
<i>The things we've done</i>

530
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:46,917
<i>Together, while our hearts</i>

531
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:48,837
<i>Were young</i>

532
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:54,877
{\an8}<i>This is too much.</i>

533
00:30:54,918 --> 00:30:56,677
{\an8}<i>Is it?</i>

534
00:31:00,357 --> 00:31:02,518
{\an8}<i>He fantasized</i>
<i>about killing Trinity.</i>

535
00:31:02,557 --> 00:31:03,917
{\an8}Who fucking didn't?

536
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:05,918
{\an8}<i>He admitted to wanting</i>
<i>to kill Ethan.</i>

537
00:31:05,958 --> 00:31:07,998
{\an8}<i>-He's just like me.</i>
<i>-Then cut it short</i>

538
00:31:08,037 --> 00:31:09,837
{\an8}<i>at finding the psycho's</i>
<i>trophies. That's enough.</i>

539
00:31:09,878 --> 00:31:11,438
{\an8}<i>You don't have to do</i>
<i>any of this with him.</i>

540
00:31:11,477 --> 00:31:14,357
{\an8}<i>I'm not forcing</i>
<i>any ideas on Harrison.</i>

541
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:15,838
{\an8}<i>I want to help him,</i>

542
00:31:15,877 --> 00:31:17,998
{\an8}<i>just like Harry helped me.</i>

543
00:31:18,037 --> 00:31:20,838
{\an8}<i>There were fucking</i>
<i>alternatives, Dexter.</i>

544
00:31:20,878 --> 00:31:24,198
{\an8}<i>Therapy! Institutionalization!</i>

545
00:31:24,237 --> 00:31:26,557
{\an8}<i>Prison might have been better</i>
<i>in the long run.</i>

546
00:31:26,598 --> 00:31:30,358
{\an8}<i>You think prison</i>
<i>would be better?!</i>

547
00:31:30,397 --> 00:31:32,118
{\an8}<i>Whose side are you on?</i>

548
00:31:32,158 --> 00:31:34,078
{\an8}<i>Harrison was born in blood.</i>

549
00:31:34,117 --> 00:31:37,237
{\an8}<i>His Dark Passenger</i>
<i>pushes him to hurt others.</i>

550
00:31:37,277 --> 00:31:39,358
{\an8}<i>This path, it's the only way.</i>

551
00:31:43,157 --> 00:31:45,077
{\an8}<i>And you fucking love it.</i>

552
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:47,918
<i>His victims</i>

553
00:31:47,957 --> 00:31:49,197
<i>were usually criminals</i>

554
00:31:49,238 --> 00:31:50,638
<i>who'd gotten away with it.</i>

555
00:31:50,677 --> 00:31:53,398
<i>That's some Batman-level
vigilante shit.</i>

556
00:31:53,437 --> 00:31:55,637
<i>And it's why
Miami Metro Homicide</i>

557
00:31:55,678 --> 00:31:57,118
<i>came to believe the Butcher</i>

558
00:31:57,157 --> 00:31:59,438
<i>was one of their own.</i>

559
00:31:59,477 --> 00:32:02,237
<i>Sergeant James Doakes.</i>

560
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:05,278
<i>But... what if they were wrong?</i>

561
00:32:05,318 --> 00:32:08,237
<i>Well, maybe the police didn't
want to keep investigating</i>

562
00:32:08,277 --> 00:32:11,358
<i>the biggest case
in Miami Metro history,</i>

563
00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:14,398
<i>but I fucking do.</i>

564
00:32:14,437 --> 00:32:16,637
<i>Because if I'm right,</i>

565
00:32:16,678 --> 00:32:19,678
<i>the Bay Harbor Butcher
could still be out there.</i>

566
00:32:19,718 --> 00:32:22,637
<i>Still feeling all butcher-y.</i>

567
00:32:22,677 --> 00:32:24,317
<i>Still a threat.</i>

568
00:32:24,358 --> 00:32:25,797
<i>And...</i>
{\an8}<i></i>

569
00:32:25,837 --> 00:32:28,277
{\an8}<i>Oh, my God. You freaked me out.</i>

570
00:32:28,318 --> 00:32:29,878
{\an8}<i>-You freaked me out.</i>
<i></i>

571
00:32:29,917 --> 00:32:32,198
{\an8}<i>-Sorry.</i>
<i>-Ooh,</i> <i>Merry Fucking Kill.</i>

572
00:32:32,237 --> 00:32:34,358
{\an8}<i>BHB. Bad guy killer.</i>

573
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:36,158
{\an8}<i>Chops them up,</i>
<i>dumps them in the ocean.</i>

574
00:32:36,198 --> 00:32:37,717
{\an8}<i>What do you think?</i>
<i>Did they get the wrong guy?</i>

575
00:32:37,757 --> 00:32:39,198
{\an8}<i>I don't know.</i>

576
00:32:39,237 --> 00:32:40,798
{\an8}<i>But if she's right,</i>

577
00:32:40,838 --> 00:32:43,117
{\an8}<i>I'd be scared shitless</i>
<i>to put it out there so publicly.</i>

578
00:32:43,158 --> 00:32:45,717
{\an8}<i>She certainly is brave.</i>

579
00:32:45,758 --> 00:32:47,238
{\an8}<i>Times like this,</i>
<i>I'm glad we live in the sticks,</i>

{\an8}<i>Trinity.</i>

632

<i>Couple days before Christmas,</i>

640
00:40:32,837 --> 00:40:34,397
{\an8}<i>Room key on the bed,</i>

641
00:40:34,437 --> 00:40:36,478

{\an8}<i>I don't know.</i>

645
00:40:51,717 --> 00:40:53,758
{\an8}<i>What's that?</i>

646

00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,597
<i>suspenseful music</i>

648
00:41:37,397 --> 00:41:38,397
{\an8}<i>Hey, fuck-o.</i>

649
00:41:56,197 --> 00:41:57,957
{\an8}<i>Why all this plastic?</i>

650
00:41:59,557 --> 00:42:03,397
{\an8}<i>You know the concept</i>
<i>of leave no trace?</i>

651
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,277
{\an8}<i>Well, it's all the more</i>
<i>important here.</i>

652
00:42:05,317 --> 00:42:09,317
{\an8}<i>A single drop of blood, a single</i>
<i>hair left behind, a print...</i>

653
00:42:09,357 --> 00:42:10,877
{\an8}<i>anything can lead</i>
<i>to getting caught.</i>

654
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:12,677
{\an8}<i>And the Code says,</i>
<i>don't get caught.</i>

655
00:42:12,717 --> 00:42:14,717
{\an8}<i>That's right.</i>

656
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,757
{\an8}<i>How many times</i>
<i>have you done this?</i>

657
00:42:28,277 --> 00:42:30,517
{\an8}<i>-A lot.</i>
<i>-How many?</i>

658
00:42:30,557 --> 00:42:33,317
<i>Go big or go home.</i>

659
00:42:33,357 --> 00:42:34,717
{\an8}<i>In the hundreds.</i>

660
00:42:34,757 --> 00:42:36,717
{\an8}<i>Holy shit.</i>

661
00:42:41,637 --> 00:42:44,477
{\an8}<i>Th-That means</i>
<i>you've saved, like,</i>

662
00:42:44,517 --> 00:42:46,077
{\an8}<i>thousands of innocent people.</i>

663
00:42:47,557 --> 00:42:50,117
<i>That's right.</i>

664
00:42:51,877 --> 00:42:54,437
{\an8}<i>You ready?</i>

665
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:59,957
{\an8}<i>If there's any moment</i>
<i>where you don't feel up to this</i>

666
00:42:59,997 --> 00:43:02,157
{\an8}<i>or you feel overwhelmed,</i>
<i>you just head outside.</i>

667
00:43:02,197 --> 00:43:05,437
{\an8}<i>No shame.</i>
<i>The first time is...</i>

668
00:43:05,477 --> 00:43:08,157
{\an8}<i>a lot.</i>

669
00:43:15,597 --> 00:43:16,917
{\an8}<i>Shit!</i>

670
00:43:20,157 --> 00:43:22,237
{\an8}<i>What the fuck?!</i>

671
00:43:25,077 --> 00:43:28,477
{\an8}<i>Hey, it's okay.</i>

672
00:43:28,517 --> 00:43:32,877
{\an8}<i>Shh...</i>

673
00:43:32,917 --> 00:43:34,397
{\an8}<i>Stop struggling. Shh.</i>

674
00:43:36,037 --> 00:43:38,397
{\an8}<i>It's the end of the road,</i>
<i>Kurt Caldwell.</i>

675
00:43:41,757 --> 00:43:44,637
{\an8}<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

676
00:43:44,677 --> 00:43:47,557
{\an8}<i>Well, look around you, Kurt.</i>

677
00:43:50,277 --> 00:43:51,636
{\an8}<i>And spare us that old chestnut</i>

678
00:43:51,677 --> 00:43:53,757
{\an8}<i>about how your father</i>
<i>did this, too.</i>

679
00:43:57,117 --> 00:44:00,077
{\an8}<i>Okay.</i>

680
00:44:00,117 --> 00:44:01,437
{\an8}<i>Yeah, you got me.</i>

681
00:44:03,237 --> 00:44:07,437
{\an8}<i>It's all me.</i>
<i>Every bit of it.</i>

682
00:44:07,477 --> 00:44:10,557
{\an8}<i>Pretty fucking amazing, huh?</i>

683
00:44:10,597 --> 00:44:13,716
{\an8}<i>Really?</i>
<i>You-you fucking murdered women.</i>

684
00:44:13,757 --> 00:44:17,117
{\an8}<i>No! I saved 'em.</i>

685
00:44:18,477 --> 00:44:20,157
{\an8}<i>They're just runaways.</i>

686
00:44:22,356 --> 00:44:24,237
{\an8}<i>Do you have any idea</i>
<i>the trauma</i>

687
00:44:24,276 --> 00:44:25,677
{\an8}<i>that they were gonna</i>
<i>go through?</i>

688
00:44:25,717 --> 00:44:27,757
{\an8}<i>I do. I saw it.</i>
<i>I saw it firsthand,</i>

689
00:44:27,797 --> 00:44:29,037
{\an8}<i>what my dad would do to them.</i>

690
00:44:29,076 --> 00:44:31,877
{\an8}<i>Hey! I told you no dad shit.</i>

691
00:44:35,917 --> 00:44:37,917
{\an8}<i>I'd pick them up on the road,</i>

692
00:44:37,957 --> 00:44:39,636
{\an8}<i>and I'd take 'em to my cabin,</i>

693
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:43,677
{\an8}<i>and I'd give them a nice room</i>
<i>and a warm meal.</i>

694
00:44:43,717 --> 00:44:46,077
{\an8}<i>And safety.</i>

695
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:47,757
{\an8}<i>But that was never enough</i>
<i>for them.</i>

696
00:44:47,797 --> 00:44:50,037
{\an8}<i>They always wanted</i>
<i>to go back out there.</i>

697
00:44:50,077 --> 00:44:53,277
{\an8}<i>And so I preserved them,</i>

698
00:44:53,317 --> 00:44:56,157
{\an8}<i>kept them safe forever.</i>

699
00:44:57,117 --> 00:44:58,597
{\an8}<i>Bullshit.</i>

700
00:44:59,877 --> 00:45:01,277
{\an8}<i>This wasn't</i>
<i>about saving anyone,</i>

701
00:45:01,316 --> 00:45:03,277
{\an8}<i>this was about power.</i>

702
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:08,957
{\an8}<i>You loved the power</i>
<i>you had over them.</i>

703
00:45:08,996 --> 00:45:13,236
{\an8}<i>It fed the darkness inside you.</i>

704
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:16,437
{\an8}<i>You loved</i>
<i>the hunt, the capture.</i>

705
00:45:16,477 --> 00:45:20,157
{\an8}<i>Their terror feeding you.</i>

706
00:45:22,397 --> 00:45:24,317
{\an8}<i>You deserve to die.</i>

707
00:45:24,356 --> 00:45:27,997
{\an8}<i>Oh, wow, Jimbo.</i>

708
00:45:28,037 --> 00:45:31,317
{\an8}<i>You really get me,</i>
<i>don't you?</i>

709
00:45:33,237 --> 00:45:34,757
{\an8}<i>So what is this?</i>

710
00:45:34,797 --> 00:45:37,557
{\an8}<i>You and your son, you're</i>
<i>some kind of vigilante team?</i>

711
00:45:38,957 --> 00:45:41,437
{\an8}<i>No, don't get me wrong.</i>
<i>I'm kinda jealous.</i>

712
00:45:41,477 --> 00:45:45,037
{\an8}<i>All the time that</i>
<i>I spent with Harrison.</i>

713
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:50,357
{\an8}<i>Kinda made me wish</i>
<i>my son was more like H here.</i>

714
00:45:50,397 --> 00:45:51,916
{\an8}<i>Yeah, then why'd you try</i>
<i>to kill me?</i>

715
00:45:54,277 --> 00:45:57,717
{\an8}<i>Oh, shit. He doesn't know.</i>

716
00:45:57,757 --> 00:46:00,797
{\an8}<i>He doesn't know what</i>
<i>you did to Matt, does he?</i>

717
00:46:02,877 --> 00:46:06,517
{\an8}<i>Revenge... for your dear old dad</i>
<i>murdering my son.</i>

718
00:46:06,557 --> 00:46:08,997
{\an8}<i>Eye for an eye.</i>
<i>Son for a son.</i>

719
00:46:09,037 --> 00:46:11,557
{\an8}<i>Nothing personal, kid.</i>

720
00:46:11,597 --> 00:46:13,157
{\an8}<i>Matt fit The Code.</i>

721
00:46:13,197 --> 00:46:15,037
{\an8}<i>Five people died</i>
<i>because of him.</i>

722
00:46:15,077 --> 00:46:17,317
{\an8}<i>And they didn't</i>
<i>receive justice</i>

723
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:19,317
{\an8}<i>because Kurt</i>
<i>covered for him.</i>

724
00:46:19,356 --> 00:46:21,676
{\an8}<i>Wait. What?</i>

725
00:46:21,717 --> 00:46:24,877
{\an8}<i>That's your rationale</i>
<i>for killing people?</i>

726
00:46:24,917 --> 00:46:27,996
{\an8}<i>Some kind of bullshit</i>
<i>justice code?</i>

727
00:46:36,997 --> 00:46:39,197
{\an8}<i>You know, When Matt was</i>
<i>on my table,</i>

728
00:46:39,236 --> 00:46:41,597
{\an8}<i>he blamed you for everything.</i>

729
00:46:41,637 --> 00:46:45,956
{\an8}<i>Just like you blame your dad.</i>

730
00:46:45,997 --> 00:46:47,876
{\an8}<i>Like father, like son.</i>

731
00:46:51,557 --> 00:46:53,797
{\an8}<i>You don't have to watch.</i>

732
00:46:56,197 --> 00:46:57,597
{\an8}<i>No, I'm good.</i>

733
00:47:22,316 --> 00:47:23,997
{\an8}<i>You okay?</i>

734
00:47:26,197 --> 00:47:27,597
{\an8}<i>I think so.</i>

735
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:31,236
{\an8}<i>If you need to</i>
<i>head up and get some air...</i>

736
00:47:37,597 --> 00:47:40,956
{\an8}<i>'Cause my work isn't done here.</i>
<i>He has to be disposed of.</i>

737
00:47:43,397 --> 00:47:45,476
{\an8}<i>I'm ready.</i>

738
00:47:55,197 --> 00:47:57,956
{\an8}<i>Can you get the garbage bags?</i>

739
00:48:10,237 --> 00:48:13,517
{\an8}<i>I generally cut them</i>
<i>into nine pieces,</i>

740
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:15,597
{\an8}<i>depending on how big they are,</i>

741
00:48:15,636 --> 00:48:17,436
{\an8}<i>for ease of transport.</i>

742
00:48:18,917 --> 00:48:20,797
<i>eerie synthesizer music</i>

743
00:49:05,797 --> 00:49:07,356
{\an8}<i>You all right?</i>

744
00:49:07,397 --> 00:49:08,797
{\an8}<i>Yeah, I'm okay.</i>

745
00:49:08,837 --> 00:49:12,156
{\an8}<i>Um, I'm gonna go get some air,</i>
<i>like you said.</i>

746
00:49:59,076 --> 00:50:00,156
{\an8}<i>Hey.</i>

747
00:50:01,997 --> 00:50:03,837
{\an8}<i>You put these bags</i>
<i>in the back of the RTV?</i>

748
00:50:20,837 --> 00:50:23,196
{\an8}<i>What happens when people</i>
<i>notice he's missing?</i>

749
00:50:23,236 --> 00:50:26,317
{\an8}<i>Well, he covered that for us</i>
<i>when he rushed home to escape.</i>

750
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:30,797
{\an8}<i>Angela'll look to his place</i>
<i>and see that he ransacked it,</i>

751
00:50:30,837 --> 00:50:34,237
{\an8}<i>packed his bags, grabbed all</i>
<i>his money from the safe.</i>

752
00:50:34,277 --> 00:50:36,317
{\an8}<i>You knew he'd run.</i>

753
00:50:36,356 --> 00:50:39,636
{\an8}<i>Everyone here in Iron Lake</i>
<i>will think he fled.</i>

754
00:50:39,676 --> 00:50:42,516
{\an8}<i>People run away</i>
<i>from their lives all the time.</i>

755
00:50:45,596 --> 00:50:47,557
{\an8}<i>No more women kidnapped</i>
<i>and killed.</i>

756
00:50:47,596 --> 00:50:48,637
{\an8}<i>That's right.</i>

757
00:50:51,036 --> 00:50:52,917
{\an8}<i>And the Dark Passenger?</i>

758
00:50:55,276 --> 00:50:57,597
{\an8}<i>Is quiet.</i>

759
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:01,157
{\an8}<i>That's how it works.</i>

760
00:51:01,196 --> 00:51:03,197
{\an8}<i>That's how we keep it</i>
<i>under control.</i>

761
00:51:07,717 --> 00:51:09,797
{\an8}<i>And the world's</i>
<i>a better place for it.</i>

762
00:51:11,397 --> 00:51:13,597
{\an8}<i>That's the idea.</i>

763
00:51:17,556 --> 00:51:19,716
{\an8}<i>Let's go home.</i>

764
00:51:29,596 --> 00:51:31,277
{\an8}<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

765
00:51:31,317 --> 00:51:32,517
{\an8}<i>Is that smoke?</i>

766
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:53,756
{\an8}<i>Harrison.</i>

767
00:51:53,797 --> 00:51:56,716
{\an8}<i>Oh, my God.</i>

768
00:51:56,756 --> 00:51:59,356
{\an8}<i>I thought you were dead.</i>

769
00:52:02,557 --> 00:52:05,717
{\an8}<i>Where were you?</i>

770
00:52:05,757 --> 00:52:10,277
{\an8}<i>Like I said, I took Harrison</i>
<i>out to see the blood moon.</i>

771
00:52:10,316 --> 00:52:11,637
{\an8}<i>What the hell happened here?</i>

772
00:52:11,676 --> 00:52:14,156
{\an8}<i>Well, I was hoping</i>
<i>you could tell us.</i>

773
00:52:14,196 --> 00:52:17,237
<i>It's Kurt's parting shot.</i>

774
00:52:17,277 --> 00:52:20,397
{\an8}<i>I kept calling you.</i>
<i>Why didn't you answer?</i>

775
00:52:20,436 --> 00:52:21,996
{\an8}<i>I turned my phone off.</i>

776
00:52:22,037 --> 00:52:24,596
{\an8}<i>I'm trying to stay present</i>
<i>for Harrison, you know?</i>

777
00:52:24,637 --> 00:52:26,796
{\an8}<i>What time did you leave?</i>

778
00:52:26,837 --> 00:52:28,556
{\an8}<i>It was around 10 p.m.</i>

779
00:52:28,596 --> 00:52:31,996
{\an8}<i>We took the RTV out,</i>
<i>had a great night.</i>

780
00:52:32,036 --> 00:52:34,036
{\an8}<i>Just lost track of time,</i>
<i>I guess.</i>

781
00:52:34,076 --> 00:52:36,236
{\an8}<i>They have to stay with us.</i>

782
00:52:36,276 --> 00:52:38,316
{\an8}<i>What?</i>

783
00:52:38,357 --> 00:52:39,997
{\an8}<i>It's okay.</i>
<i>We can stay at the inn.</i>

784
00:52:40,037 --> 00:52:43,076
{\an8}<i>Mom, they can stay</i>
<i>with us, right?</i>

785
00:53:01,716 --> 00:53:02,956
{\an8}<i>Bet you're starving.</i>

786
00:53:02,996 --> 00:53:04,837
{\an8}<i>Yep.</i>
<i>-Me, too.</i>

787
00:53:04,876 --> 00:53:06,516
{\an8}<i>I was thinking eggs and bacon?</i>

788
00:53:06,556 --> 00:53:08,596
{\an8}<i>Maybe some of those</i>
<i>frozen hash browns?</i>

789
00:53:08,636 --> 00:53:11,396
{\an8}<i>And a damn fine cup of coffee.</i>

790
00:53:18,277 --> 00:53:20,956
{\an8}<i>I should probably help</i>
<i>the kids in the kitchen.</i>

791
00:53:20,996 --> 00:53:23,116
{\an8}<i>Breakfast wizard.</i>

792

793
00:53:47,716 --> 00:53:49,716
