00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:14,829
He asked you for drugs?

178
00:11:14,864 --> 00:11:16,957
Your words, not mine.

179
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:19,923
Anyway, so he gets me outside
over by the dumpsters.

180
00:11:23,368 --> 00:11:24,665
So I could...

181
00:11:24,701 --> 00:11:26,825
So you could do him that favor?

182
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,660
Right. Except out of nowhere,
he fucking jumped me.

183
00:11:29,695 --> 00:11:32,261
He just started attacking you
with no provocation?

184
00:11:32,296 --> 00:11:34,328
Yeah, just started
swinging at me.

185
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:36,327
And look, okay,
this is gonna sound crazy,

186
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:38,430
but before he started
pounding on me,

187
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:41,032
he poked me in the neck, with,
like, a needle or some shit.

188
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,893
- A needle?
- Yeah, and so, I was like,

189
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:47,195
"What the fuck?" And I look up,
and I see the police rolling up,

190
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,428
and I'm like,
what the actual fuck?

191
00:11:49,463 --> 00:11:51,496
And that's when he started
throwing fists, man.

192
00:11:53,362 --> 00:11:55,032
- Wait. Wait.
- He's got fast hands, yo.

193
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:57,494
He starts punching you
after the cops show up?

194
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:00,265
Yeah, man. Yeah, just right
as they rolled up.

195
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,066
And the thing he poked you with,
you're sure it was a needle?

196
00:12:02,101 --> 00:12:04,097
Well, I-I didn't really
get a good look at it, okay?

197
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:06,096
It all happened so fast,
but, like, I mean, look.

198
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:09,356
I still got the fucking mark.
Check it.

199
00:12:34,396 --> 00:12:36,398
Kurt said I had
to bring you in alive.

200
00:12:36,434 --> 00:12:38,457
You know what?

201
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:44,925
He'll just have to understand.

202
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:53,129
Right?

203
00:12:53,164 --> 00:12:56,793
I mean, you know, shit.

204
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:07,129
I think the school's closed for,
you know, Christmas break.

205
00:13:07,165 --> 00:13:09,132
Yeah, well, they haven't
changed the locks

206
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:12,929
since I was Matt's wrestling
coach, so...

207
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:14,492
What about security cameras?

208
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:16,758
Oh, you mean
for our precious children?

209
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:20,163
No, those are reserved
for tracking white deer

210
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:22,458
because that's what's important, right?

211
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:24,698
Sometimes it feels good to be bad.

212
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:28,661
Don't you think?

213
00:13:28,696 --> 00:13:30,330
Yeah.

214
00:13:30,365 --> 00:13:34,530
Besides, what are they gonna
do-- arrest me? Again?

215
00:13:53,426 --> 00:13:54,998
<i>Fucking snow.</i>

216
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:57,593
<i>Even a three-year-old
could track me.</i>

217
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,599
<i>Come on, big man,
head on down that creek</i>

218
00:14:23,634 --> 00:14:25,857
<i>so I can get back to my son.</i>

219
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:33,261
First perfect game

220
00:14:33,296 --> 00:14:35,424
- in school history.
- That's Matt?

221
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:39,262
Yeah. He was about your age.

222
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:41,658
Ah, I used to go
to every one of his games.

223
00:14:41,693 --> 00:14:44,590
That's what I loved most
about being a dad.

224
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:49,192
Whoa. He lettered
in three sports?

225
00:14:49,228 --> 00:14:53,059
Yeah. He was...

226
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:55,363
he was special.

227
00:14:55,398 --> 00:14:58,359
Well, how's he doing?
Have you talked to him lately?

228
00:14:58,395 --> 00:15:01,757
Actually...
I haven't, you know.

229
00:15:01,793 --> 00:15:03,896
Uh, we never really
communicated very well.

230
00:15:03,932 --> 00:15:05,693
Not like you and me.

231
00:15:05,729 --> 00:15:07,824
Oh.

232
00:15:09,596 --> 00:15:11,625
Does that mean he's not
coming home for Christmas?

233
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,429
Uh... you know,
with all the search party,

234
00:15:15,464 --> 00:15:18,630
I think he's afraid
to show his face around here.

235
00:15:18,665 --> 00:15:21,457
That's too bad.

236
00:15:21,492 --> 00:15:22,929
People are pretty forgiving.

237
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:25,362
Especially during the holidays.

238
00:15:26,764 --> 00:15:29,823
Not everyone.

239
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:32,857
Hey, let's go
have some fun, huh? Come on.

240
00:15:44,494 --> 00:15:46,928
Oldest trick
in the goddamn book.

241
00:15:46,963 --> 00:15:48,830
You want to play games?

242
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,495
I can do this all fucking day.

243
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,494
<i>You might have
all day, but I don't.</i>

244
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:05,261
- Shit. This is great.
Yeah. Right?

245
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:07,298
Small towns love them
some sport, huh?

246
00:16:09,131 --> 00:16:11,430
I mean, what else
we gonna do, right?

247
00:16:11,465 --> 00:16:13,659
Okay.

248
00:16:17,368 --> 00:16:19,025
Uh, let's see...

249
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,793
That one...

250
00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:22,366
All right.

251
00:16:24,627 --> 00:16:27,361
- Put that ball right in here.
- All right.

252
00:16:27,396 --> 00:16:28,760
All right, wait for me
to get down there.

253
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:30,626
Okay.

254
00:16:36,993 --> 00:16:38,593
Okay.

255
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,395
All right, anytime.

256
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:56,294
Whoa!

257
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:58,964
Wow. Matt's got nothing
on you, huh?

258
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:00,291
Yeah, well, I led
the Mountain League

259
00:17:00,327 --> 00:17:01,961
in batting my senior year.

260
00:17:01,996 --> 00:17:04,831
Taught him everything...

261
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:07,024
he knows.
All right, that's enough.

262
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,496
Let's turn this thing off before
I hurt myself showing off.

263
00:17:12,401 --> 00:17:14,864
You ever play?

264
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,626
- What, Jim never taught you?
- No.

265
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,857
All right.
Let's see what you got.

266
00:17:34,062 --> 00:17:36,723
<i>Summer camp.</i>

268
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:40,329
<i>to make his stand.</i>

269
00:17:43,765 --> 00:17:45,725
All right. Batter up!

270
00:17:48,498 --> 00:17:49,865
Sorry.

271
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:51,059
It's okay, you don't have
to apologize.

272
00:17:51,094 --> 00:17:53,461
Okay. Here you go.

273
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:57,424
It's all right.

274
00:17:57,459 --> 00:17:59,428
You just weren't taught right.

275
00:17:59,463 --> 00:18:02,865
Y-You're swinging with
your wrists, all right?

276
00:18:02,901 --> 00:18:04,390
Good instincts,
but you've got to use

277
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:05,799
your whole body, right?

278
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,630
You've got to step
with your legs.

279
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:10,733
Swing. Whole body.

280
00:18:10,768 --> 00:18:12,663
There you go. Good.
One more time.

281
00:18:12,698 --> 00:18:14,932
Step. Whole body.

282
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:17,730
All right, now, this time,
step, whole body,

283
00:18:17,765 --> 00:18:19,423
snap your wrists. Ready?

284
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,762
Step, whole body, snap!

285
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:23,929
There you go. There.

286
00:18:23,964 --> 00:18:26,431
You're not afraid,
are you?

287
00:18:26,467 --> 00:18:28,527
- No.
- Good.

288
00:18:35,993 --> 00:18:37,824
Now...

289
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,824

290
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:46,131
Okay. Just... relax.

once we arrested Miles,

353
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:04,832
I got him to snitch on
his supplier.

354
00:24:04,867 --> 00:24:07,066
Piece of shit
named Jasper Hodge.

355
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:09,328
I coordinated with the Staties
to make the arrest,

356
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:11,997
- but we got there too late.
- It was too late?

357
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:13,465
Yeah. When we went
to make the arrest,

358
00:24:13,501 --> 00:24:16,558
he was already dead.

359
00:24:16,593 --> 00:24:18,490
Accidentally OD'd
on his own product

360
00:24:18,525 --> 00:24:20,262
while he was pressing pills.

361
00:24:20,298 --> 00:24:21,766
How long had he been dead
when you found him?

362
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:24,656
About an hour before
we got there.

363
00:24:24,692 --> 00:24:29,325
So... maybe Miles
tipped Jasper off

364
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,966
that the police were coming?

365
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:33,494
Maybe he OD'd because
he didn't want to spend

366
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:35,825
- all those years in prison?
- I don't think so.

367
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,764
I mean, when I brought Miles
and Jim into the station,

368
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:39,589
Miles gave up Jasper quick.

369
00:24:39,625 --> 00:24:41,127
But we held Miles for 24 hours,

370
00:24:41,162 --> 00:24:43,032
and Jasper was dead in ten.

371
00:24:44,527 --> 00:24:46,364
How long did you keep Jim
in custody?

372
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,163
No more than an hour. I mean,
I wasn't trying to punish him.

373
00:24:48,198 --> 00:24:49,725
I just wanted to make sure
he cooled off.

Where does Kurt have my son?

00:26:48,768 --> 00:26:52,231
Fuck you!
Okay. Okay. Okay.

384
00:26:52,266 --> 00:26:55,632
I think Kurt's got him
up in his cabin on Stern road.

385
00:26:55,667 --> 00:26:58,498
That's where I was to bring you.

386
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,027
That's all I know.

387
00:27:01,062 --> 00:27:04,498
I was just doing my job.

388
00:27:04,534 --> 00:27:06,861
No-Nothing personal.

389
00:27:11,865 --> 00:27:13,757
We're talking about my son.

390
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,329
There's nothing more personal
than that.

391
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:23,732
Do you see this often?

392
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,823
Fentanyl overdose?
Are you kidding?

393
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:27,899
- By the guy making the pills.
- Eh, it happens.

394
00:28:27,934 --> 00:28:31,192
He had, um,
ketamine in his system, too.

395
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:32,733
That could explain it.

396
00:28:32,768 --> 00:28:34,827
- Was it lethal drug interaction?
- No.

397
00:28:34,863 --> 00:28:36,391
A party drug.

398
00:28:36,427 --> 00:28:38,098
Probably took it to mellow out.

399
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:40,832
- Made him sloppy.
- So, there's nothing to suggest

400
00:28:40,868 --> 00:28:42,358
that Jasper's death was
anything other

401
00:28:42,393 --> 00:28:44,163
than an accidental overdose?

402
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:46,291
Well, not unless
someone put a gun to his head

403
00:28:46,327 --> 00:28:47,624
and made him snort a line.

404
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,890
Just want to check
one more thing.

405
00:29:01,695 --> 00:29:04,227
- Fucking faster, Dex!
- I'm going as fast as I can.

406
00:29:04,263 --> 00:29:06,133
- Text him. Warn him.
- It's risky.

407
00:29:06,168 --> 00:29:08,824
- You have to let him know.
- I don't want to tip off Kurt.

408
00:29:10,326 --> 00:29:12,923
This is the good stuff.

409
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:17,128
This is what they call
single malt Scotch whisky.

410
00:29:17,164 --> 00:29:20,624
Best there is.
Only kind I drink.

411
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,298
- Thank you.
- Go ahead. Give it a shot.

412
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:28,628
- Hmm?

413
00:29:29,966 --> 00:29:33,332
Ooh. That kind of tastes
like a Band-Aid.

414
00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:42,893
You want to put
some ice on that?

415
00:29:42,929 --> 00:29:44,627
No, I'm good.

416
00:29:44,663 --> 00:29:46,593
Mm.

417
00:29:49,868 --> 00:29:53,258
Got to stop doing that
to yourself, kid.

418
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:54,924
I mean, look, I get it.

419
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,361
I-I used to do stuff like that
when I was your age.

420
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:58,932
But the sooner you stop
punishing yourself

421
00:29:58,967 --> 00:30:02,230
for whatever you think
is wrong with you...

422
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:06,158
Look, all I'm trying
to say is that

423
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:07,658
you are who you are.

424
00:30:07,694 --> 00:30:10,794
Find what gives you joy,
and you do that thing.

425
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,759
No apologies.

426
00:30:12,795 --> 00:30:17,093
Whatever it is that brings you
pleasure in this world.

427
00:30:17,129 --> 00:30:20,631
How do you...

428
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:22,489
H-How do you do that?

429
00:30:22,525 --> 00:30:25,158
You just... take the leap.

430
00:30:27,231 --> 00:30:31,190
Well, I have
worked up quite an appetite.

431
00:30:31,226 --> 00:30:32,331
How about you?

432
00:30:32,366 --> 00:30:34,564
Starving.

433
00:30:48,162 --> 00:30:51,628
Whoo! This is gonna be tasty.

434
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,733
Uh, hey, I'm-I'm getting
a little cold.

435
00:31:03,768 --> 00:31:05,594
Where's the firewood
for the stove?

436
00:31:05,629 --> 00:31:08,697
Um, it's around the side of
the house. I'll get it.

437
00:31:08,732 --> 00:31:09,997
Oh, no, no, no. I got it.

438
00:31:10,032 --> 00:31:13,527
Come on, Harrison.
Come on. Come on.

439
00:31:26,366 --> 00:31:27,991
You good?

440
00:31:28,026 --> 00:31:29,660
Yeah.

441
00:31:29,695 --> 00:31:31,929
You know, if it's getting late
and you need to be home,

442
00:31:31,964 --> 00:31:33,728
I'm happy to give you a ride.

443
00:31:33,763 --> 00:31:36,395
No. No way.

444
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:38,124
I wouldn't want to miss out
on all the venison.

445
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,230
Yeah, it's smelling
pretty tasty in there.

446
00:31:44,427 --> 00:31:45,659
I'm glad we're doing this, kid.

447
00:31:47,092 --> 00:31:48,927
Me, too.

448
00:31:48,963 --> 00:31:50,824
All right. Hurry up.

449
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:12,064
Shit.

450
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:15,232
So I'm trying to make weight.

451
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:19,491
And I-- you know. I start
wearing a-a garbage bag, right?

452
00:32:19,526 --> 00:32:21,130
- Mm-hmm.
- And then go for a run.

453
00:32:21,165 --> 00:32:24,228
I'm drenched in sweat,
I got terrible BO,

454
00:32:24,264 --> 00:32:27,226
and I'm wearing
a frigging Hefty bag.

455
00:32:27,262 --> 00:32:28,729
- Mm.
- I run around the corner,

456
00:32:28,764 --> 00:32:30,764
and there she is,

457
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,094
- walking her dog.
- Oh, man.

458
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:35,832
I had been gearing up

459
00:32:35,868 --> 00:32:38,495
to ask her to the Spring Dance
all week,

460
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:41,032
but, you know, at school,
there's always people around,

461
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:43,632
and I... I don't know.
I just kept pussying out.

462
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:44,995
- I get it.
- So, this time,

463
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:46,424
I say, "Okay, forget about it."

464
00:32:46,459 --> 00:32:48,198
I'm-I'm gonna take my shot.

465
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:50,125
I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask her.
Right there, right then.

466
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,458
What'd she say?

467
00:32:52,494 --> 00:32:55,429
Well, she looked me
up and down,

468
00:32:55,465 --> 00:32:58,997
like I had just escaped
from a mental ward, and said,

469
00:32:59,032 --> 00:33:02,332
"Do I look like I date
white trash?"

470
00:33:06,061 --> 00:33:08,130
Just laid me out.

471
00:33:08,165 --> 00:33:10,429
But you probably don't have
that problem.

472
00:33:10,464 --> 00:33:13,857
You're going out with the police
chief's daughter, right?

473
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:17,463
Uh, I don't know.
After that last wrestling match,

474
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:20,495
I-I think she looks at me like
I just escaped a mental ward.

475
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:23,657
Well, you know, I guess some
people are just never

476
00:33:23,692 --> 00:33:26,529
gonna understand guys
like you and me.

477
00:33:28,161 --> 00:33:29,958
You know what I say?

478
00:33:29,993 --> 00:33:31,894
Fuck 'em.

479
00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:33,961
- Yeah.

480
00:33:33,996 --> 00:33:36,158
- Fuck 'em!
- Fuck 'em!

481
00:33:36,193 --> 00:33:38,890
Attaboy.

482
00:33:41,201 --> 00:33:42,362
Ah.

483
00:33:45,893 --> 00:33:50,390
So... so-so what happened
with you going to jail?

484
00:33:50,425 --> 00:33:52,927
W-What was that about?

485
00:33:52,962 --> 00:33:56,228
Well, it was...

486
00:33:56,263 --> 00:33:58,161
just a little mix-up
with some DNA.

487
00:33:58,196 --> 00:34:02,033
Well, it turns out
that my dad

488
00:34:02,068 --> 00:34:06,927
murdered a teenage girl
in Iron Lake 25 years ago.

489
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:09,032
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

490
00:34:10,964 --> 00:34:13,991
He was a really messed up guy.

491
00:34:14,026 --> 00:34:17,857
Wasn't easy growing up being
his son, I can tell you that.

492
00:34:17,892 --> 00:34:20,295
And I guess, you know,
since I spent the night

493
00:34:20,331 --> 00:34:23,090
in jail because of him,
it still isn't easy.

494
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,393
Eh, you know.

495
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:29,029
Sometimes a kid
just ends up suffering

496
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:32,890
for the...
choices of his father.

497
00:34:35,393 --> 00:34:38,599
So, hey, why did the dad that

498
00:34:38,634 --> 00:34:40,924
abandoned you for ten years

499
00:34:40,959 --> 00:34:45,559
end up getting in a fight
with you at my truck stop?

500
00:34:45,594 --> 00:34:48,631
Oh, I-I don't even know
if it was a fight

501
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:50,960
as much it was just me

502
00:34:50,996 --> 00:34:53,598
being pissed at him

503
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,925
- all the time.
- Ah.

504
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,793
I just feel like I keep wanting
something from him that...

505
00:35:02,931 --> 00:35:06,224
What? What do you want, kid?

506
00:35:06,259 --> 00:35:08,425
I don't know. I...

507
00:35:08,461 --> 00:35:11,829
When I came here,
I wanted answers.

508
00:35:11,865 --> 00:35:14,093
A-And now, as much as I...

509
00:35:14,128 --> 00:35:17,828
fucking hate to say it...

510
00:35:17,864 --> 00:35:19,631
I-I think I was also

511
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:23,824
looking for, you know...

512
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,329
Connection. Real connection
with your dad. Hmm?

513
00:35:30,158 --> 00:35:31,694
Yeah.

514
00:35:35,293 --> 00:35:37,093
But I-I think he knew.

515
00:35:37,128 --> 00:35:38,258
Even when I was five,

516
00:35:38,293 --> 00:35:40,357
<i>I think, I think he knew</i>

517
00:35:40,392 --> 00:35:42,662
<i>how different we were.</i>

518
00:35:42,697 --> 00:35:45,956
<i>Yo, this is Harrison. Leave a
message and I'll hit you back.</i>

519
00:35:49,033 --> 00:35:51,665
Well, w-we don't get
each other on, like,

520
00:35:51,701 --> 00:35:56,265
a-a normal,
father-son level.

521
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,894
I-I feel like he's always
holding something back from me,

522
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:03,330
or... I don't know.

523
00:36:03,365 --> 00:36:06,896
Whatever blood-bond most fathers
