00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:56,500

Well, my body size is average,

- I know what that means.

264
00:13:06,764 --> 00:13:09,730
And dozens of people in
Iron Lake have that same rifle.

265

shattered his femur

00:17:36,986 --> 00:17:40,504
Just... five minutes, okay?

356
00:17:40,537 --> 00:17:43,343
Thanks, Ange-- Chief Bishop.

357
00:17:45,141 --> 00:17:47,084
Audrey, you come with me.

358
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:52,459
Harrison.

359
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:00,261
Oh.

360
00:18:00,295 --> 00:18:01,796
Sorry. Protocol.

361
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,820
Just hang tight.

362
00:18:28,229 --> 00:18:30,982
- I'll give you some privacy.
- Thank you.

363
00:18:31,016 --> 00:18:33,340
What the hell?

364
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:37,112
Angela thinks
I killed Matt Caldwell.

365
00:18:37,146 --> 00:18:40,310
This has nothing
to do with Kurt. You're safe.

366
00:18:42,264 --> 00:18:44,632
Hey, I've been in tougher spots.

367
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,614
I'll get out of this.

368
00:18:46,649 --> 00:18:48,750
There's no way I'm leaving you.

369
00:18:48,784 --> 00:18:50,382
I promise.

370
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:52,458
- Night, Logan.
- Good night, Esther.

371
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:56,007
Angela's got this... theory,
but it'll never hold up.

372
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,409
We'll be on the road
in a day or two.

373
00:18:58,443 --> 00:19:00,610
Well, what am I supposed
to do till then?

374
00:19:00,644 --> 00:19:01,919
Go find Tess at The Tavern.

375
00:19:01,953 --> 00:19:04,129
She'll feed you
and give you a room.

376
00:19:04,163 --> 00:19:07,074
- Okay.
- Come on, guys.

377
00:19:10,043 --> 00:19:11,702
We'll get through this.

378
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:15,221
The world needs us.

379
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:20,653
I'll be waiting for you.

380
00:19:20,687 --> 00:19:22,219
And I'll find you.

381
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:26,027
Hey.

382
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,236
Stay tough.

383
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:34,754
Turn around.
Hands behind your back.

384
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:42,494
You're a good man, Logan.

385
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:45,562
I hope you are, too,
for Harrison's sake.

386
00:19:46,871 --> 00:19:49,905
I can't give you
all the details yet, but...

387
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:55,026
You know how Harrison told you
Jim wasn't his real name?

388
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,225
You said Harrison was high
and didn't mean it.

389
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:00,197
I didn't know it at the time,

390
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:03,013
but there's more to that story.

391
00:20:03,047 --> 00:20:05,536
Like what?
What the hell is going on?

392
00:20:06,624 --> 00:20:07,967
Honey,

393
00:20:08,001 --> 00:20:10,782
I know this might be
hard to believe...

394
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:14,430
...but Jim is dangerous.

395
00:20:14,465 --> 00:20:15,995
Dangerous?

396
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:17,619
Then why were you dating him?

397
00:20:17,654 --> 00:20:19,255
Why'd you let him
into our house?

398
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,829
Sometimes people
aren't who you think they are.

399
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:33,959
Wait, Audz.

400
00:20:33,993 --> 00:20:35,174
Go home.

401
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,767
Give Harrison some space.

402
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,069
Why? Is he dangerous too?

403
00:20:41,254 --> 00:20:42,971
No.

404
00:20:43,004 --> 00:20:44,800
Look...

405
00:20:44,835 --> 00:20:47,068
I promise I will tell you
everything tomorrow.

406
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:08,515
Turn around.
Hands through the slot.

407
00:21:10,058 --> 00:21:11,844
All right.

408
00:21:16,446 --> 00:21:18,652
This is nuts.

409
00:21:18,686 --> 00:21:20,347
It's really putting me
in touch with my fear

410
00:21:20,382 --> 00:21:22,842
of Harrison growing up
without a father.

411
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,824
I know you've been there.

412
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:26,800
Go to the far side of the cell.

413
00:21:32,811 --> 00:21:34,509
Tuna.

414
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,001
Huh. Some things never change.

415
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,380
I'm gonna go make sure
that Harrison is set up okay.

416
00:21:41,413 --> 00:21:42,846
I'm not going anywhere.

417
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,075
And thank you.

418
00:21:49,918 --> 00:21:51,997
Sons need their fathers.

419
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,486
Thanks for this.

420
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,394
Oh, you're doing me a favor.
Never fun eating alone.

421
00:22:18,306 --> 00:22:21,248
I know this must be
really, really tough for you.

422
00:22:21,282 --> 00:22:22,685
I'm not the one in jail.

423
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:24,670
I don't want to see Jim
go away, either.

424
00:22:24,704 --> 00:22:27,731
Look, you got here around
the same time Matt disappeared.

425
00:22:27,766 --> 00:22:29,809
Did you hear or-or see anything

426
00:22:29,843 --> 00:22:31,571
that could help
exonerate your dad?

427
00:22:36,682 --> 00:22:39,563
I-I wasn't in town yet, so I...

428
00:22:39,596 --> 00:22:40,746
can't help.

429
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,249
Are you gonna finish your fries?

430
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:53,624
I should head back
to the station.

431
00:22:53,658 --> 00:22:55,510
- Later, Coach.
- Yeah.

432
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,585
Thanks for stopping by.

433
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:00,025
Oh, and, uh,

434
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:02,355
try not to eat hamburgers
three meals a day.

435
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,852
I don't want you going up
too many weight classes

436
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:07,979

after New Year's.

How can I help?

451
00:24:11,248 --> 00:24:13,737
We've had some deaths
in Iron Lake

452
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,811
that are very similar
to an old Miami Metro case.

454
00:24:19,078 --> 00:24:21,536
<i>Cristo.</i>
That was a gruesome one.

455
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:24,928
I looked at the autopsy photos
on the police database.

What can you tell me
about Sergeant Doakes?

459
00:24:32,854 --> 00:24:35,157
I sat next to him
every day for ten years.

460
00:24:35,191 --> 00:24:36,944
Do you believe that he did it?

461
00:24:36,978 --> 00:24:40,847
I did at the time, but there
were a few other theories.

My, uh, my ex-wife...

463
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,930
My old captain actually thought

464
00:24:45,963 --> 00:24:47,819
it was someone else
in the precinct.

465
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:49,324

<i>Front door unlocked,

His gas truck's here.

ketamine.

511
00:27:47,381 --> 00:27:50,420
You picked up a healthy--
or unhealthy--

512
00:27:50,454 --> 00:27:52,300
amount from Dr. Patel.

513
00:27:52,335 --> 00:27:54,288
Yeah, I needed it
for Vincent van Goat.

514
00:27:54,322 --> 00:27:55,337
You know he was sick.

515
00:28:00,488 --> 00:28:02,025
Do you recognize this man?

00:28:02,058 --> 00:28:03,493
Yeah, it's the piece of shit

517
00:28:03,528 --> 00:28:05,572
who sold the drugs
that almost killed my son.

518
00:28:05,606 --> 00:28:07,519
We...

519
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:10,044
ended up having
an unfortunate encounter.

520
00:28:10,078 --> 00:28:11,934
About that encounter.

521
00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:14,910
Miles O'Flynn
testified to me that,

522
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:18,099
"Just before he started pounding
on me, he poked me in the neck.

523
00:28:18,133 --> 00:28:20,979
Like, with a needle
or something."

524
00:28:21,014 --> 00:28:23,062
That was the exact same day
you picked up the ketamine

525
00:28:23,096 --> 00:28:24,819
and several syringes
from Dr. Patel.

526
00:28:24,853 --> 00:28:26,131
You think I drugged him?

527
00:28:27,378 --> 00:28:29,742
<i>I saw Logan question him
in this very station.</i>

528
00:28:29,777 --> 00:28:31,051
<i>There's no way he was drugged.</i>

529
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,613
<i>Only because Logan and Teddy</i>

530
00:28:32,648 --> 00:28:34,340
<i>showed up at Crystal Bar
before you could do it.</i>

531
00:28:34,373 --> 00:28:36,513

want to believe.

00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,189
You worked forensics in Miami.

533
00:28:40,222 --> 00:28:42,555
You've seen
autopsy photos before.

534
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:44,511
Yes and yes.

535
00:28:48,957 --> 00:28:51,224
Jasper Hodge.

536
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:56,368
Okay, I have no idea
where you're going with this.

537
00:28:58,387 --> 00:28:59,888
It's called...

538
00:28:59,922 --> 00:29:01,895
- <i>A weal mark.</i>
- ...a weal mark.

539
00:29:01,928 --> 00:29:03,847
I heard he died

540
00:29:03,882 --> 00:29:05,637
of an accidental
fentanyl overdose.

541
00:29:05,671 --> 00:29:07,042
I can't say I'm sorry.

542
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:10,822
He also had ketamine
in his system.

543
00:29:10,855 --> 00:29:12,292
And only in his system.

544
00:29:12,325 --> 00:29:14,176
None was found anywhere
in his house or his car.

545
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,128
- Well, I can't speak to that.
- Well...

546
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,747
...then speak to this.

549
00:29:27,126 --> 00:29:29,553
Same weal marks.

Same drug showing up
in their tox report.

551
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,362
It's what we call a pattern.

552
00:29:36,396 --> 00:29:38,787
And it's how I know that you,
Dexter Morgan...

553
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,623
...are the Bay Harbor Butcher.

554
00:29:50,524 --> 00:29:52,476
The Bay Harbor Butcher

555
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:55,603
was Miami Metro Detective
Sergeant James Doakes.

556
00:29:55,636 --> 00:29:58,357
Not everyone believes that.

557
00:30:00,975 --> 00:30:03,563
Tomorrow you'll be arraigned
for the murder of Matt Caldwell.

558
00:30:03,597 --> 00:30:05,488
I'm gonna do my best
to see that it sticks

559
00:30:05,521 --> 00:30:07,339
and you get life without parole.

560
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,606
And then,

561
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:10,980
win or lose,

562
00:30:11,014 --> 00:30:12,257
you're gonna have
a little reunion

563
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:14,113
with your old friend
Angel Batista.

564
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:16,706
Yeah.

565
00:30:18,748 --> 00:30:21,437
I met him at that Cop-Con thing.

566
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,957
He's on his way up from Miami
as we speak.

567
00:30:26,234 --> 00:30:28,657
We're gonna extradite
your ass to Florida

568
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:31,249
where you'll stand trial
as the Bay Harbor Butcher.

569
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:36,298
Florida.

570
00:30:37,806 --> 00:30:40,136
A state with the motherfucking
death penalty.

571
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,155
Turn off the camera.

572
00:30:51,555 --> 00:30:53,078
Why the hell would I do that?

573
00:30:53,113 --> 00:30:54,710
I'll talk.

574
00:30:57,749 --> 00:31:01,296
If you've got something to say,
just say it to the camera.

575
00:31:16,772 --> 00:31:17,926
Listening.

576
00:31:18,885 --> 00:31:20,896
What if I told you
you were right?

577
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:22,106
Well, then,
you'd be admitting to--

578
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,707
I'm not admitting anything.

579
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:26,172
I'm saying you were right

580
00:31:26,206 --> 00:31:27,995
about Kurt Caldwell.

581
00:31:28,028 --> 00:31:30,073
I can prove it.

582
00:31:30,107 --> 00:31:33,171
Ange, you know in your heart

583
00:31:33,204 --> 00:31:35,089
that Kurt killed Iris.

584
00:31:35,123 --> 00:31:37,939
She was just his first.

585
00:31:39,403 --> 00:31:42,250
He's been active for 25 years.

586
00:31:43,689 --> 00:31:45,388
Very active.

587
00:31:45,422 --> 00:31:46,984
What the hell are you
talking about?

588
00:31:47,017 --> 00:31:48,068
Them.

589
00:31:50,562 --> 00:31:52,987
Go to Kurt's cabin.

590
00:31:53,021 --> 00:31:56,507
100 yards north
of the front door,

591
00:31:56,541 --> 00:32:00,030
under a deadwood pile,
there's a hatch.

592
00:32:00,063 --> 00:32:02,809
Open it, and you'll see
what real evil looks like.

593
00:32:02,844 --> 00:32:05,584
I have dedicated
my entire life to this.

594
00:32:05,618 --> 00:32:07,504
Yeah, and you've been met
with scorn and ridicule

595
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:10,352
at every turn because you've had
a gut feeling but no proof.

596
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:11,818
You go to that cabin,

597
00:32:11,852 --> 00:32:14,923
and you'll finally have it.

598
00:32:14,956 --> 00:32:16,165
Proof.

599
00:32:26,243 --> 00:32:27,325
Fuck!

600
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,741
You turned off
the camera. What happened?

601
00:32:34,775 --> 00:32:35,921
Put him back in his cell.

602
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,399
I've got to check something out.

603
00:32:37,432 --> 00:32:39,571
- And that would be?
- Just fucking do it.

604
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:47,017
Harrison.

605
00:32:47,051 --> 00:32:49,733
I-I came to get my stuff,

606
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:52,899
since it doesn't look like
we're gonna move in together.

607
00:32:52,933 --> 00:32:55,906
Come in. Your stuff's upstairs.

608
00:32:58,367 --> 00:32:59,553
I'm sorry.

609
00:33:01,089 --> 00:33:03,189
I think this is all my fault.

610
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,677
How could this possibly
be your fault?

611
00:33:10,261 --> 00:33:12,145
I told my Mom what you said
at the party.

612
00:33:12,178 --> 00:33:13,905
If I had just kept
my mouth shut--

613
00:33:13,938 --> 00:33:15,820
Th-This-this
isn't because of you.

614
00:33:15,853 --> 00:33:18,184
Then what's going on?

615
00:33:18,217 --> 00:33:19,979
No one will tell me
what's happening.

616
00:33:20,013 --> 00:33:21,642
I know.

617
00:33:25,126 --> 00:33:26,591
I just...

618
00:33:26,624 --> 00:33:28,731
want this to be over.

619
00:33:28,765 --> 00:33:31,201
For things to go back to normal.

620
00:33:32,702 --> 00:33:34,967
Normal...

621
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:36,983
What's that?

622
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:38,802
Things certainly weren't normal

623
00:33:38,837 --> 00:33:40,626
when you and I were on track
to becoming brother and sister.

624
00:33:43,442 --> 00:33:46,126
So, you think this arrest means
our parents are breaking up?

625
00:33:49,992 --> 00:33:53,255
My dad told me
to wait at The Inn.

626
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:55,240
But it's really nice to see you.

627
00:33:56,484 --> 00:33:58,434
Well, my mom said
to give you space.

628
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,523
But I guess we don't always have
to do what our parents want.

629
00:34:12,698 --> 00:34:16,366
Remember when you thought
not killing was the problem?

630
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,257
How's that going for you?

631
00:34:20,688 --> 00:34:22,764
I can figure this out.

632
00:34:22,797 --> 00:34:25,292
Angela's got her teeth in you.

633
00:34:25,325 --> 00:34:26,857
She's never gonna let go.

634
00:34:28,516 --> 00:34:29,633
You did.

635
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,484
I was your sister.

636
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,586
I trusted you.

637
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:36,922
I loved you.

638
00:34:36,956 --> 00:34:39,548
Angela's pretty fucking far
from that right now.

639
00:34:39,581 --> 00:34:42,201
Enough!

640
00:34:44,885 --> 00:34:46,607
Enough.

641
00:34:48,978 --> 00:34:52,782
Hey, Logan,
can I get some water?

642
00:34:52,815 --> 00:34:55,429
Kind of been doing
a lot of talking today.

643
00:35:04,611 --> 00:35:05,923
Yeah.

644
00:35:05,957 --> 00:35:08,832
You talked Angela
right out of the station.

645
00:35:08,867 --> 00:35:10,430
I'd give anything to know
what you said to her

646
00:35:10,463 --> 00:35:11,766
when the camera was off.

647
00:35:19,886 --> 00:35:21,550
I don't want to hurt you.

648
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:24,460
So, Angela was right about you.

649
00:35:24,493 --> 00:35:26,987
She's a good cop
and so are you,

650
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,795
but this is inevitable.

651
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,453
So, just give me the keys.

652
00:35:32,487 --> 00:35:34,691

Of-of course I'm angry.

You didn't just make
